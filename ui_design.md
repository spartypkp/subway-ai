Project UI/UX Design Document
Overview
The interface is designed around the concept of expert AI agents represented as nodes in a system similar to subway maps. The UI is structured in three distinct levels of detail, allowing users to smoothly transition between high-level project overview and detailed conversations. The design emphasizes clarity, intuitive navigation, and efficient context management.
Level 1: Project Overview Map
The highest level view presents all experts in a unified interface. Each expert appears as a major hub, with their respective conversation timelines flowing downward. This view helps users understand the overall project structure and relationships between different expert domains.
The project overview displays:

Expert hubs arranged horizontally across the viewport
Simplified timeline representations showing major conversation branches
Visual indicators of timeline length and complexity
Basic metadata about each expert's domain and purpose
Navigation controls for moving between experts

Navigation in this view is accomplished through horizontal scrolling or arrow buttons positioned at the viewport edges. A position indicator shows which expert is currently centered, similar to carousel navigation patterns.
Level 2: Expert Timeline Pane
When focusing on a specific expert, the interface transitions to a detailed subway-map visualization. This view occupies the full viewport, with the expert's configuration and long-term memory displayed at the top of the screen.
The expert pane contains:

Expert header section showing configuration and domain knowledge
Main timeline represented as a prominent vertical line
Conversation nodes displayed as "stations" along the timeline
Branch points showing alternate conversation paths
One-sentence summaries for each conversation node
Visual hierarchy using line weight to distinguish main and branch lines
Timeline selection controls

The subway map metaphor is fully realized in this view:

The main conversation appears as a primary line running vertically
Branch conversations split off at clear decision points
Each "station" (conversation node) displays a brief summary
Selected timelines are highlighted visually
Branch lines use different visual styling to distinguish them from the main line

Navigation between experts is maintained through:

Left/right arrow buttons at the viewport edges
Horizontal scroll gestures on touchpad or touch devices
Keyboard shortcuts for quick expert switching

Level 3: Detailed Chat View
When a specific timeline is selected, the interface transitions to a traditional chat view. This level provides full conversation detail while maintaining context of the larger structure.
The chat view features:

Full conversation history for the selected timeline
Traditional message interface with user and AI responses
Text entry field at the bottom of the viewport
Clear visual indication of which timeline is being viewed
Easy return path to the subway map view
Persistent expert context and configuration display

Core Interaction Patterns:
The system follows several key interaction patterns:

Timeline Selection: Clicking a timeline in the subway map view highlights it and makes it the active conversation target
Branch Creation: New branches can be initiated from any conversation node
Expert Switching: Horizontal navigation between expert panes maintains the current detail level
Context Preservation: When switching between experts, the system remembers the last viewed timeline
Text Input: The message input field remains consistently positioned at the bottom of the viewport
Zoom Navigation: Clear transitions between the three detail levels maintain user orientation

Visual Hierarchy:
The interface uses consistent visual language across all levels:

Main timelines are represented with thicker lines
Branch lines use distinct but complementary styling
Active selections are clearly highlighted
Navigation controls maintain consistent positioning
Expert context is always visible and accessible

Next Steps for Implementation:
To move forward with development, priority should be given to:

Creating the core expert pane view with subway map visualization
Implementing smooth transitions between detail levels
Developing the timeline selection and chat view integration
Building the expert switching navigation system
Designing the branching mechanism for timeline creation

This design provides a solid foundation for future enhancements such as branch merging and cross-references between experts, while maintaining focus on the core user experience.
